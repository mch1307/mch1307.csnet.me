I am developing a small domotics back-end in Go, mainly as a learning method. I already did that [in NodeJs][1] and as I wanted to learn Golang, I decided to re-develop same kind of tool. This time, I am doing it more &#8220;properly&#8221; in terms of testing coverage. And as Go is a compiled language, I have setup an automated build, test and release process using Travis CI, Coveralls and [goreleaser][2]. Those tools are amazing!

The code is available [here][3] and the small doc [here][4]

As this is in the early stages, I would welcome anyone wanting to do some tests ðŸ˜‰

#### Current features:

  * Niko Home Control: 
      * zero conf, auto detects the NHC controller on the network (LAN)
      * switches
      * dimmer

#### Roadmap:

  * Support NHC thermostat and energy modules
  * API endpoint to log external domotics components
  * GUI?
  * Link with Jeedom
